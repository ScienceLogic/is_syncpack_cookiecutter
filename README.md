Visual Studio Code
================================
The generated package includes VSCode configuration settings to improve the SyncPack development process.

DevContainer
------------
The generated package will contain a [Visual Studio Code DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)  
When you open the generated folder with VSCode you will get a prompt to open the workspace within the container.  
This Container contains a functional environment for developing and testing your SyncPack steps without the need of a full PowerFlow system.

**Usage**
1. After completing the cookie cutter run, open the generated folder in Visual Studio Code
1. The .devcontainer folder should be detected and you should be prompted to re-open the workspace in the container. Click Yes.

If you are not prompted or you miss it, Open the command pallet (ctrl+shift+P) and run `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`

Your environemt should now be ready.
If you need any additional syncpacks or packages to be available, simply `pip install` them into your container. Remember to add them to your dependancies!
